# neuromorphic-integrated-control
A MATLAB implementation of a neuromorphic robust framework for integrated estimation and control in dynamical systems using spiking neural networks, featuring learning-free LIF neurons mimicking LQR control with EMSIF filtering. Includes case studies for both simple systems and satellite rendezvous maneuvers.
